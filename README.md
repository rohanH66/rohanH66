# hello! i'm rohan hablani 👋  

I’m an aspiring high school student, biomedical engineer, and student researcher interested in how **biological systems and electrical engineering** can intersect to make life better, whether that’s through regenerative biomaterials, cardiac microtissues, or active noise-cancelling systems.  

I enjoy deconstructing real-world problems and constructing solutions that end both with measurable results and a noticeable impact on someone’s life. Every design I’ve made, from microfluidic scaffolds to competitive robots, follows the same philosophy: **to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and to make a difference while doing so.**  

enjoy my github :)
