# hello! i'm rohan hablani 👋

i’m an aspiring high school student, biomedical engineer, and student researcher interested in how **biological systems and electronics** can intersect to make life better , whether that’s through regenerative materials, cardiac microtissue modeling, or active noise-cancelling systems.  

every design i’ve made, from microfluidic scaffolds to competitive robots, follows the same philosophy: **to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.**
