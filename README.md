# hello! i'm rohan hablani 👋

I’m an aspiring high school, biomedical engineer, and student researcher interested in how **biological systems and electronics** can intersect to make life better, whether that’s through regenerative materials, cardiac microtissue modeling, or active noise-cancelling systems.  

I like building projects that start with a real-world problem and end with measurable results. Every design I’ve made, from microfluidic scaffolds to competitive robots, comes from the same philosophy: **to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible.**
